# Configuration Manager
For whatever function a device with an ESP8266 might have, it could be that you want the user to change some settings or parameters, such as the speed of a motor, or the color of a LED. The configuration manager provides a method to modify parameters from the broswer which will be accessible from the software application. The parameters are generated from a JSON file. The configuration manager stores a struct with configuration data in the EEPROM. Structure can be changed at build time, data can be changed at runtime through the GUI which is also auto generated from the JSON.
