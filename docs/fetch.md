# HTTPS Requests
Fetching or posting data to the internet is one of the core tasks of an IoT device. Doing so over HTTP is implemented quite well in the default ESP8266 Arduino libraries, but for HTTPS requests things are less straightforward. This class implements arbitrary HTTPS requests in a secure way, without requiring any specific certificates or fingerprints to be hard coded in the application. A full certificate store is automatically downloaded on build, and stored in PROGMEM.
