# WiFi Manager
The function of the WiFi manager is to help the user connect to a WiFi network. If no known network is found the ESP8266 will start a hotspot with a captive portal in which the network settings can be changed. WiFi information will be preserved in memory so that the ESP8266 will connect automatically in the future.
